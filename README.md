KISS is a Tcl script that helps you keep your scripts simple and concise. It's designed to be easy to use and to help you avoid common mistakes that can lead to bugs and errors.

## Installation

To install KISS, simply download the `kiss.tcl` file and save it in your desired directory. You can then load the script into your Tcl interpreter using the `source` command:

```
source /path/to/kiss.tcl
```

## Usage

Once KISS is loaded into your Tcl interpreter, you can use its functions in your scripts. Here are some examples of how to use KISS:

### Printing Messages

```
.help "+SkyNet › food,spells,xrated,pg,poke,chainsaw,beat,burn,kill,murder,kidnap,voodoo,skin,stab,hatchet,choke,kills,pistol,gun,vampire,asskick,acid,eunich "
```

### Reading Input

You can then use any of the command listed in "help" function to read input from the console:

```
So if I want to use the .kill command it will look like this: ~f · .kill computertech
